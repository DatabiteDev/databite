# Databite Documentation

This directory contains the documentation site for the Databite project. The docs are built with Mintlify.

## Development

Install the [Mintlify CLI](https://www.npmjs.com/package/mint) to preview your documentation changes locally. To install, use the following command:

```
npm i -g mint
```

Run the following command at the root of your documentation, where your `docs.json` is located:

```
mint dev
```

View your local preview at `http://localhost:3000`.

## Publishing changes

If you deploy with Mintlify, install the GitHub app from your [dashboard](https://dashboard.mintlify.com/settings/organization/github-app) to propagate changes from this repo to your deployment. When configured, changes are deployed to production automatically after pushing to the default branch.

## Need help?

### Troubleshooting

- If your dev environment isn't running: Run `mint update` to ensure you have the most recent version of the CLI.
- If a page loads as a 404: Make sure you are running in a folder with a valid `docs.json`.

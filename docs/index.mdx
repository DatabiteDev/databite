## Three-Tier Hierarchy

Databite uses a clear three-tier hierarchy for managing integrations:

1. **Connector** - A template/blueprint that defines what properties and configurations are available for a service.
2. **Integration** - An instance of a connector where configuration values have been filled in.
3. **Connection** - When someone actually uses an integration to connect to a service.

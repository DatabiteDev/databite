## Welcome to Databite SDK

Databite helps you self-host a simple API server for connectors and connect to it from your frontend. You run a server with `@databite/server`, then use `@databite/connect` in your app to authenticate users and create connections.

## Why Databite?

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Server" icon="server" href="/packages/server">
    Host a REST API that exposes connectors, integrations, connections, flows, and sync jobs
  </Card>
  <Card title="React Connect" icon="react" href="/packages/connect">
    Use a drop-in modal to authenticate and create connections from your app
  </Card>
  <Card title="Build Connectors" icon="wrench" href="/packages/build">
    Fluent API to define custom connectors and integrations
  </Card>
  <Card title="Sync Engine" icon="arrows-rotate" href="/packages/engine">
    Optional scheduling and execution for sync jobs
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## Quick Start

Get up and running with Databite in minutes:

```bash
# Install main packages
npm install @databite/server @databite/connect

# Optional (custom connectors, sync, types)
npm install @databite/build @databite/connectors @databite/engine @databite/types
```

<Steps>
  <Step title="Start your server">
    Create and run a Databite server that hosts connectors and integrations
  </Step>
  <Step title="Add integrations">
    Add built-in or custom connectors and create integrations on your server
  </Step>
  <Step title="Connect from your app">
    Use the React modal to authenticate and create connections via your server
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Architecture

The Databite SDK follows a modular architecture with clear separation of concerns:

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Main Libraries">
    - **@databite/server** - Express server with REST API
    - **@databite/connect** - React components for client integration
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Supporting Libraries">
    - **@databite/build** - Fluent API to build connectors
    - **@databite/connectors** - Pre-built connectors
    - **@databite/engine** - Optional sync engine
    - **@databite/types** - Shared TypeScript types
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Three-Tier Hierarchy

Databite uses a clear three-tier hierarchy for managing integrations:

1. **Connector** - A template/blueprint that defines what properties and configurations are available
2. **Integration** - An instance of a connector where specific values have been filled in
3. **Connection** - When someone actually uses an integration to connect to a service

## Welcome to Databite

Databite helps you self-host a simple API server for connectors and connect to it from your frontend. You run a server with `@databite/server`, then use `@databite/connect` in your app to authenticate users and create connections.

## Quick Start

Get up and running with Databite in minutes:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Start your server">
    Create and run a Databite server that hosts connectors and integrations
  </Step>
  <Step title="Add integrations">
    Add built-in or custom connectors and create integrations on your server
  </Step>
  <Step title="Connect from your app">
    Use the React modal to authenticate and create connections via your server
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Three-Tier Hierarchy

Databite uses a clear three-tier hierarchy for managing integrations:

1. **Connector** - A template/blueprint that defines what properties and configurations are available
2. **Integration** - An instance of a connector where specific values have been filled in
3. **Connection** - When someone actually uses an integration to connect to a service

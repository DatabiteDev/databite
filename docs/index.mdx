## Quick Start

Get up and running with Databite in minutes:

```bash
# Install core packages
npm install @databite/build @databite/flow @databite/types

# Install additional packages as needed
npm install @databite/connectors @databite/connect @databite/engine
```

<Steps>
  <Step title="Create Your First Connector">
    Use the fluent API to define your connector with authentication flows and
    actions
  </Step>
  <Step title="Build Interactive Workflows">
    Create user-friendly authentication and data processing flows with the Flow
    engine
  </Step>
  <Step title="Deploy and Sync">
    Set up automatic data synchronization with the Engine package
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Architecture

The Databite SDK follows a modular architecture with clear separation of concerns:

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Core Packages">
    - **@databite/types** - Shared TypeScript types and interfaces -
    **@databite/build** - Core SDK for building connectors with fluent API -
    **@databite/flow** - Flow engine for complex authentication and data
    workflows
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Integration Packages">
    - **@databite/connectors** - Library of pre-built connectors (Slack, Trello,
    etc.) - **@databite/connect** - React components for UI integration -
    **@databite/engine** - Data synchronization and execution engine -
    **@databite/ai** - AI-powered connector generator from API documentation
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Three-Tier Hierarchy

Databite uses a clear three-tier hierarchy for managing integrations:

1. **Connector** - A template/blueprint that defines what properties and configurations are available
2. **Integration** - An instance of a connector where specific values have been filled in
3. **Connection** - When someone actually uses an integration to connect to a service

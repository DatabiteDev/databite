# Contributing to Databite

First off, thank you for considering contributing to Databite. It's people like you that make Databite such a powerful and versatile tool for API integrations. Your contributions help us build a more connected world where data flows seamlessly between services.

## üåü How You Can Help

### üöÄ **Building Connectors for New APIs** (Most Valuable Contribution!)

The **best way to contribute** to Databite is by building connectors for APIs that aren't yet supported. Every new connector expands our ecosystem and helps developers integrate with more services.

**Why this matters:**

- Connectors are the heart of Databite - they're what make integrations possible
- Each new connector benefits the entire community
- You'll learn the API deeply while helping others
- It's a great way to understand how Databite works

**What we're looking for:**

- Popular APIs that developers frequently need to integrate with
- APIs with good documentation and stable endpoints
- Services that would benefit from Databite's authentication flows and data synchronization

### üõ†Ô∏è Other Ways to Contribute

- **Bug fixes** - Help us squash bugs and improve stability
- **Documentation** - Improve guides, examples, and API documentation
- **Testing** - Write tests for new features or improve test coverage
- **Performance** - Optimize existing code and improve performance
- **UI/UX** - Enhance the React components and user experience
- **Examples** - Create real-world usage examples and tutorials

## üó∫Ô∏è Our Vision & Roadmap

### Current Focus (2024)

- **Expanding Connector Library**: Building connectors for the most requested APIs
- **AI-Powered Generation**: Improving our AI connector generator
- **Developer Experience**: Making it easier to build and test connectors
- **Performance**: Optimizing sync engines and reducing latency

### Long-term Vision

- **Universal API Integration**: Make any API integrable with Databite
- **No-Code Solutions**: Enable non-developers to create integrations
- **Enterprise Features**: Advanced security, compliance, and monitoring
- **Ecosystem Growth**: Foster a community of connector developers
